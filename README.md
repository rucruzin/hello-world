# Hello-World
## First Official Coding

Hello, my name is Rhoeben. I am into art and design. I went to College for Creative Studies a while back pursuing a major in Industrial Design. It's a very competitive 
curriculum and I just feel like I couldn't fit it. I did learn a lot of things from it and still appreciate world that we live today through visual art and design. Especially digital world we live in now, we depend a lot of things on the digital side of web browsing. We can play games online, watch movies online, mae money online and control things online.
